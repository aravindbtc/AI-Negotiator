AI Negotiation Agent Project 🤝💰
🎯 Overview
Build an AI-powered negotiation system with BuyerAgent and SellerAgent for trading perishable goods like mangoes and coffee. Choose from three modes: human buyer vs. AI seller, human seller vs. AI buyer, or fully autonomous AI negotiation. Agents use distinct personas (Aggressive, Analytical, Diplomatic, Wildcard) to strategize, adapt, and maximize profits, powered by LLaMA-3 via Ollama.
Features:

Personality-driven negotiations with dynamic persona switching 📣
Regret logic to evaluate deal profitability 📉
Support for human-in-the-loop and autonomous modes 🧠
Product data from products.json (e.g., Coffee, Cardamom) 🍋

Goal: Secure profitable deals within 15 rounds while maintaining persona consistency.
